      <guid>/2017/06/10/provision-settlement-fal0002ee/</guid>
      <description>Remember:
Companies recognize a provision (liability) when an obligation to perform future services or payments arises. Although the amount or the timing of the obligation are not certain, provisions are recognized in the balance sheet as liabilities if the obligation is likely to occur and the liability amount can be estimated reliably (usually based on historical data or past experience).
When provisions are settled, the liability decreases.
Provisions can be classified as both short-term liabilities or long-term liabilities.</description>

Contingent liabilities are reported with an amount in the notes to the financial statements but they are not recognized as liabilities in the balance sheet because there is too much uncertainty as to whether there will be an obligation, when will the obligation happen or the amount of the obligation.</description>

Under the equity method the investment account is affected by the proportional changes in the investee’s net assets (net assets is that same as assets minus liabilities so net assets is another name for equity).
The consolidation method requires the following steps:
Eliminate the investment account of the parent and eliminate the total equity of the subsidiary

      <description>Remember: The cost flow assumptions used to find the cost of goods sold and the ending inventory have no connection with the cash received or paid.
The Net Realizable Value (NRV) of inventory is the value for which the inventory can be sold. If the inventory cannot be sold for an amount higher than its cost (i.e., the NRV is lower than the cost of inventory) then the inventory should be reported at the NRV amount instead of its cost.</description>

      <description>Remember: The Net Realizable Value (NRV) of inventory is the value for which the inventory can be sold. If the inventory cannot be sold for an amount higher than its cost (i.e., the NRV is lower than the cost of inventory) then the inventory should be reported at the NRV amount instead of its cost.
To record the decrease in the value of the inventory to its NRV the following journal entry is made: increase the cost of goods sold and decrease the inventory.</description>

      <description>Remember: Cash (proceeds) from sale of property, plant and equipment = Value of the asset (net of amortization or depreciation) +/- Gain/Loss on sale.
In the indirect method of building the cash flow statement, the non-cash expenses (e.g., depreciation expense) or gains are added to the net profit to find the cash from operating activities.
Cash flow from investing activities relates to the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.</description>
