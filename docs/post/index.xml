      <description>Remember: The Net Realizable Value (NRV) of the inventory is the value for which the inventory can be sold. If the inventory cannot be sold for an amount higher than its cost (i.e., the NRV is lower than the cost of inventory) then the inventory should be reported at the NRV amount instead of its cost.
To record the decrease in the value of the inventory to its NRV the following journal entry is made: increase the cost of goods sold and decrease the inventory.</description>

      <description>Remember: Cash from the sale of property, plant and equipment is equal to the value of the asset (net of amortization or depreciation) plus/minus the gain/loss.
In the indirect method the expenses (e.g., depreciation expense) or gains that do not involve cash are added to the net profit to find the cash from operating activities.
Cash flow from investing activities relates to the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.</description>
