title: depreciation gain cash fafs0001es
---

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
patent <- sample(9000:11000,1,replace=T) 
building <- sample(80000:100000,1,replace=T) 
amortization <- sample(400:700,1,replace=T) 
depreciation <- sample(4000:5000,1,replace=T)
cost <- sample(40000:60000,1,replace=T) 
acc_depr <- sample(20000:30000,1,replace=T) 
gain <- sample(8000:10000,1,replace=T) 
cash_op <- depreciation + amortization - gain
cash_op
year <- 2015
```


**Remember:**
Cash from the sale of property, plant and equipment is equal to the value of the asset (net of amortization or depreciation) plus/minus the gain/loss. 

In the indirect method the expenses (e.g., depreciation expense) or gains that do not involve cash are added to the net profit to find the cash from operating activities.

**Question:**
During `r year` Castro Company buys patents for $`r format(patent, big.mark=",")` (paid in cash) and a building for $`r format(building, big.mark=",")` (paid in cash). During `r year` the amortization expense of patents was $`r format(amortization, big.mark=",")` and the depreciation expense of the building was $`r format(depreciation, big.mark=",")`. Also during `r year` equipment with an initial cost of $`r format(cost, big.mark=",")` and an accumulated depreciation of $`r format(acc_depr, big.mark=",")` was sold for a gain of $`r format(gain, big.mark=",")` (cash transaction). Assume a net profit of zero. What would be the net cash flow from operating activities (through the indirect method)?

**Solution:** $`r format(cash_op, big.mark=",")`
