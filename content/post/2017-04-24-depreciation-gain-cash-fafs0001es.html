<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Cash from the sale of property, plant and equipment is equal to the value of the asset (net of amortization or depreciation) plus/minus the gain/loss.</p>
<p>In the indirect method the expenses (e.g., depreciation expense) or gains that do not involve cash are added to the net profit to find the cash from operating activities.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question:</strong> During 2015 Castro Company buys patents for $10,310 (paid in cash) and a building for $91,950 (paid in cash). During 2015 the amortization expense of patents was $455 and the depreciation expense of the building was $4,355. Also during 2015 equipment with an initial cost of $42,018 and an accumulated depreciation of $21,514 was sold for a gain of $8,988 (cash transaction). Assume a net profit of zero. What would be the net cash flow from operating activities (through the indirect method)?</p>
