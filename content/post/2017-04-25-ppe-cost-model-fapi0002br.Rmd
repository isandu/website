```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
cash <- sample(9000:11000,1,replace=T) 
price <- sample(19000:20000,1,replace=T)
mk <- sample(20000:22000,1,replace=T) 
```


**Remember:**
The cost of any asset is the sum of all the costs incurred to bring the asset to its intended use.

**Question:**
Company A paid $`r format(cash, big.mark=",")` cash for equipment used in the business. At the time of purchase the equipment had a list price of $`r format(price, big.mark=",")`. When the balance sheet was prepared, the market value of the equipment was $`r format(mk, big.mark=",")`. Which of the three amounts is the most relevant amount that should be used for measurement subsequent to initial recognition under the cost model?

1. $`r format(cash, big.mark=",")`

2. $`r format(price, big.mark=",")`

3. $`r format(mk, big.mark=",")`

4. $`r format(cash, big.mark=",")` at the day of the purchase, $`r format(mk, big.mark=",")` at the balance sheet date

***

**Solution:**
$`r format(mk, big.mark=",")`
