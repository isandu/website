---

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
year <- 2016
bi <- sample(100000:116000,1,replace=T)
purch <- sample(600000:700000,1,replace=T)
sales <- sample(400000:500000,1,replace=T)
grmg <- 0.3
cogs <- (1 - grmg)*sales
ei <- bi + purch - cogs
cogs
ei
```

**Remember:**
Beginning balance + Increases - Decreases = Ending balance

Gross margin = (Sales - Cost of goods sold) / Sales
