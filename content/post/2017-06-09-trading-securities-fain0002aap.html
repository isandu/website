<p><strong>Remember:</strong> A company that invests in the shares of other companies (i.e., an investor) can use three accounting methods to record these investments: (1) <strong>fair value</strong> method (for Trading securities [e.g., trading securities can be short-term investments in other companies, usually in small percentages] and Available-for-Sales securities [e.g., available-for-sales securities can be long-term investments in other companies, usually in small percentages]); (2) <strong>equity method</strong> (for investments in associates [e.g., when the investor has between 25% and 50% of the shares of the investee]); (3) <strong>consolidation method</strong> (for subsidiaries [e.g., when the investor has over 50% of the shares of the investee]).</p>
<p>Changes in fair values only matter under the fair value method. Changes in the fair value of trading securities create an <strong>Unrealized Gain (or Loss)</strong> that affects directly the income statement. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sales securities create an <strong>Unrealized Gain (or Loss)</strong> that is recorded directly in the “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income OCI - Reserves” section of the Equity.</p>

<li><p>An unrealized loss of $50,000 in the Other Comprehensive Income section</p></li>
