<hr />
<p>Textainer, one of the world largest lessor of containers, holds at the beginning of 2016 a fleet of containers with a book value (carrying amount) of $364,400 thousand. Textainer uses a straight-line method of depreciation for its containers. The estimated residual value is $181,000 thousand and the remaining estimated useful life is 13 years.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>
<p>What is the depreciation expense for containers recorded by Textainer for the year ended 2016? (amounts in $ thousands)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>$15,283</p></li>
<li><p>$28,031</p></li>
<li><p>$14,108</p></li>
<li><p>$56,062</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{years} * (carrying amount - residual value)\)</span></p>
<p>$14,108</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question 2</strong></p>
<p>For only this question assume that in 2017 Textainer revises downwards the estimated residual value due to a significant decrease in container resale prices as a result of the decreased cost of new containers. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn about Textainer if all the other conditions from the initial text of the problem remain the same?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The depreciation expense of 2017 is lower than the depreciation expense of 2016 and the carrying amount of containers in 2017 is the same as the carrying amount of 2016</p></li>
<li><p>The depreciation expense of 2017 is lower than the depreciation expense of 2016 and the carrying amount of containers in 2017 is lower than the carrying amount of 2016</p></li>
<li><p>The depreciation expense of 2017 is higher than the depreciation expense of 2016 and the carrying amount of containers in 2017 is lower than the carrying amount of 2016</p></li>
<li><p>The depreciation expense of 2017 is higher than the depreciation expense of 2016 and the carrying amount of containers in 2017 is the same as the carrying amount of 2016</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{years} * (carrying amount - lower residual value)\)</span> = higher depreciation expense</p>
<p>Answer: c)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question 3</strong></p>
<p>For only this question assume that the containers of Textainer are impaired in 2017. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn about Textainer if all the other conditions from the initial text of the problem remain the same? Assume that net income is smaller that average total assets.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The Return-on-Assets cannot be calculated after the impairment</p></li>
<li><p>The Return-on-Assets is higher after the impairment compared to its level before impairment</p></li>
<li><p>The Return-on-Assets is the same after the impairment compared to its level before impairment</p></li>
<li><p>The Return-on-Assets is lower after the impairment compared to its level before impairment</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Journal entry impairment: increase in expense and decrease in assets ; Net income is lower and average total assets are lower after the impairment and net income is (in general) lower than average total assets; ROA is lower after the impairment</p>
<p>Answer d)</p>
