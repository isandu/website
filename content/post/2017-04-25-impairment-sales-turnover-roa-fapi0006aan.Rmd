**Remember:**
When recording an impairment the impairment expense account increases and the property, plant and equipment account decreases.

**Question:**
Barrick Gold Corp., the world's largest gold miner by production, took $8.7 billion of write-downs in the second quarter of 2016 and slashed its dividend, in a stark example of the fallout from gold's precipitous price decline. With gold prices down by more than 20%, Barrick joined a host of other miners forced to write down the value of mines acquired. The write-down (write-down is synonym with impairment loss) of $8.7 billion leads to (ignore depreciation expense effects):

1. A decrease in the asset turnover (Sales / Average assets)

2. A decrease in RoA (Net profit / Average assets)

3. An increase in net cash from investing activities

4. A decrease in net cash from investing activities

***

**Solution:**
Point 2.
