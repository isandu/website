<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>A dairy company overstated its ending inventory for the year ended December 31, 2015. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn for the year 2015:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is no change in the inventory turnover and the gross profit margin is overstated.</p></li>
<li><p>The inventory resident period is overstated and the gross profit margin is understated.</p></li>
<li><p>The inventory turnover is understated and the gross profit margin is overstated.</p></li>
<li><p>The inventory resident period is understated and there is no change in the gross profit margin.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>BIDE formula: Beginning inventory + Purchases - COGS = Ending inventory (overstated) then Beginning inventory + Purchases - Ending inventory (overstated) = COGS (understated)</p>
<p>Inventory turnover = COGS (understated) / average inventory (overstated): understated</p>
<p>Gross profit = (Sales - COGS (understated)) / Sales: overstated</p>
<p>Point 3.</p>
