<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<p>The following concepts are relevant for bonds:</p>
<p>par value is the amount expected to be paid at maturity</p>
<p>c% is the annual coupon rate or the stated rate or the nominal rate</p>
<p>i% is the annual effective interest rate</p>
<p>id% is the effective discount rate used if the payments of coupon are more frequent than one year</p>
<p>n represents the number of compounded periods per year</p>
<p>t is the number of years for which the bond is issued</p>
<p>proceeds is the proceeds (cash) received from the issuance of a bond</p>
<p>Calculations related to bonds:</p>
<p>coupon (or periodic cash payment) = P <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c\%}{n}\)</span></p>
<p>proceeds = par value <span class="math inline">\(\times (1+id\%)^{-n \times t}\)</span> + coupon <span class="math inline">\(\times \frac{1- (1+id\%)^{-n \times t}}{id\%}\)</span></p>
<p>total interest paid = c% <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> par value <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> t</p>
<p>interest expense each period = beginning balance bond * id%</p>
<p>ending balance bond = beginning balance bond + interest expense each period - coupon</p>
<p>total interest expense = par value + total interest paid - proceeds</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>A company issues a bond for par value â‚¬1e+05, coupon rate 4% with an issue date 1 January 2018 and maturity date 31 December 2020 and semi-annual coupon payments. The annual effective interest rate is 5% and the effective discount rate is 2.47%.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What are the bond proceeds?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the interest expense for June 2018 (i.e., for the first six months)?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the ending balance of the bond at 31 December 2018?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the total interest paid?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the total interest expense/</p></li>
<li><p>How is the issuance of the bond recorded?</p></li>
<li><p>How is the interest expense of the bond recorded for the first six months?</p></li>
<li><p>How is the payment of the bond (in 2020) recorded?</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>1e+05 <span class="math inline">\(\times (1+2.47\%)^{-2 \times 3}\)</span> + coupon <span class="math inline">\(\times \frac{1- (1+2.47\%)^{-2 \times 3}}{2.47\%}\)</span> is approximately 97,408.58</p></li>
<li><p>What is the interest expense for June 2018 (i.e., for the first six months)?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>97,408.58 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 2.47% = 2,405.992</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the ending balance of the bond at 31 December 2018?</li>
</ol>
<p>Beginning balance + interest expense in June 2018 + interest expense in December 2018 - coupon June 2018 - coupon December 2018 = approximately 98,232</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the total interest paid?</li>
</ol>
<p>12,000</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the total interest expense?</li>
</ol>
<p>approximately 14,589</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How is the issuance of the bond recorded?</li>
</ol>
<p>Increase cash and increase bond-liability with 97,408.58</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How is the interest expense of the bond recorded for the first six months?</li>
</ol>
<p>Increase Interest expense with 2,405.992, decrease the cash with 2,000 and increase the bond with 405.992</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How is the payment of the bond (in 2020) recorded?</li>
</ol>
<p>Decrease cash and the bond with 1e+05</p>
