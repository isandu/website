```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
par <- 100000
coupon_rate <- 4
i <- 5
id <- 2.47
n <- 2
t <- 3
coupon <- ((coupon_rate/2)/100) * par
proc <- (par * (1+(id/100))^(-n*t)) + (coupon * ((1-((1+(id/100))^(-n*t)))/(id/100)))

```


**Remember:**

The following concepts are relevant for bonds:

par value is the amount expected to be paid at maturity

c\% is the annual coupon rate or the stated rate or the nominal rate

i\% is the annual effective interest rate

id\% is the effective discount rate used if the payments of coupon are more frequent than one year

n represents the number of compounded periods per year

t is the number of years for which the bond is issued

proceeds is the proceeds (cash) received from the issuance of a bond


Calculations related to bonds:

coupon (or periodic cash payment) = P $\times$  $\frac{c\%}{n}$ 

proceeds = par value $\times (1+id\%)^{-n \times t}$ + coupon $\times \frac{1- (1+id\%)^{-n \times t}}{id\%}$

total interest paid = c\% $\times$ par value $\times$ t

interest expense each period = beginning balance bond * id\% 

ending balance bond = beginning balance bond + interest expense each period - coupon

total interest expense = par value + total interest paid - proceeds

**Question:**

A company issues a bond for par value â‚¬`r format(par, big.mark=",")`, coupon rate `r format(coupon_rate, big.mark=",")`\% with an issue date 1 January 2018 and maturity date 31 December 2020 and semi-annual coupon payments. The annual effective interest rate is `r format(i, big.mark=",")`\% and the effective discount rate is `r format(id, big.mark=",")`\%.

1. What are the bond proceeds?

2. What is the interest expense for June 2018 (i.e., for the first six months)? 

3. What is the ending balance of the bond at 31 December 2018?

4. What is the total interest paid?

5. What is the total interest expense/

6. How is the issuance of the bond recorded?

7. How is the interest expense of the bond recorded for the first six months?

8. How is the payment of the bond (in 2020) recorded?

***

**Solution**

1. `r format(par, big.mark=",")` $\times (1+`r id`\%)^{-`r n` \times `r t`}$ + coupon $\times \frac{1- (1+`r id`\%)^{-`r n` \times `r t`}}{`r id`\%}$ is approximately `r format(proc, big.mark=",")`

2. What is the interest expense for June 2018 (i.e., for the first six months)? 

`r format(proc, big.mark=",")` $\times$ `r id`\% = `r format(int_exp_1, big.mark=",")`

3. What is the ending balance of the bond at 31 December 2018?

Beginning balance + interest expense in June 2018 + interest expense in December 2018 - coupon June 2018 - coupon December 2018 = approximately 98,232

4. What is the total interest paid?

12,000

5. What is the total interest expense?

approximately 14,589

6. How is the issuance of the bond recorded?

Increase cash and increase bond-liability with `r format(proc, big.mark=",")`

7. How is the interest expense of the bond recorded for the first six months?

Increase Interest expense with `r format(int_exp_1, big.mark=",")`, decrease the cash with `r format(coupon, big.mark=",")` and increase the bond with `r format(int_exp_1-coupon, big.mark=",")`

8. How is the payment of the bond (in 2020) recorded?

Decrease cash and the bond with `r format(par, big.mark=",")`
