<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Discounts decrease the cost of purchased inventory and hence, decrease the cost of goods sold.</p>
<p>Capitalizing expenses means placing costs on the balance sheet and not in the income statement.</p>
<p>Recording unearned revenues means that revenues (in the income statement) will be recorded at a later point.</p>
<p>Impairment expenses decrease the profit.</p>

<li><p>The company would try to record unearned revenues</p></li>
