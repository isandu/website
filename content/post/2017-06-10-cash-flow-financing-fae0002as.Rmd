---

```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
ltd <- 17060
shares <- 8500
borrow <- 6580
div <- 230
int <- 1439
op <- 4884
cf <- -ltd + shares + borrow - div
```

**Remember:**

Purchases or sales for cash of long term debt or shares and payments in cash of dividends are classified as cash flows from financing activities. 


***

**Question**

The following information is available: (1) payment of long-term debt `r format(ltd, big.mark=",")`, (2) proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares `r format(shares, big.mark=",")`, (3) proceeds from borrowing `r format(borrow, big.mark=",")`, (4) dividend paid `r format(div, big.mark=",")`, (5) interest expense `r format(int, big.mark=",")`, (6) operating income `r format(op, big.mark=",")`. What will the statement of cash flows show (use the direct method).

***

**Solution**

(1) + (2) + (3) + (4) = `r format(cf, big.mark=",")`
