```{r echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
year <- 2016
a1 <- sample(210:230,1,replace=T) 
a2 <- sample(240:260,1,replace=T) 
l1 <- sample(40:60,1,replace=T) 
l2 <- sample(70:80,1,replace=T) 
div <- sample(110:120,1,replace=T) 
res <- (a2-l2) - (a1-l1) + div
```

**Remember:**
Beginning balance equity + Net income - Dividends +/- changes in other comprehensive income = Ending balance equity

**Question:**
A transportation company balance sheet shows at December 31, `r year` and December 31, `r year-1` the following (in € million):

Account           |   2016   |     2015  |
----------------- | -------- | --------- |
Total assets      | `r a2  ` | `r a1`    |
Total liabilities | `r l2  ` | `r l1`    |

***

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the company paid dividends of €`r div` million. There are no other changes in equity or other comprehensive income. What is the net income during the year ended December 31, `r year` (in € million)?
