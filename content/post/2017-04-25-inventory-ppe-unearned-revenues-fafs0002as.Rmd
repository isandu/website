**Remember:**
Discounts decrease the cost of purchased inventory and hence, decrease the cost of goods sold.

Capitalizing expenses means placing costs on the balance sheet and not in the income statement.

Recording unearned revenues means that revenues (in the income statement) will be recorded at a later point.

Impairment expenses decrease the profit.
