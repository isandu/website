<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<p>Beginning balance retained earnings + Net income - Dividends = Ending balance retained earnings</p>
<p>Equity = Shares capital + Additional paid-in capital + Retained Earnings - Treasury shares</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>The following information is available at December 2015, in millions:</p>
<p>Ordinary share capital $0.002 par value, 200,000,000 shares issued</p>
<p>Additional paid-in capital: $84,000,000</p>
<p>Retained earnings: $250,000,000</p>
<p>During 2016 the following were recorded:</p>
<p>Net income: $446,000,000</p>
<p>Issuance of 8,000,000 ordinary shares for a market value of $8 per share</p>
<p>Purchase of 2,000,000 treasury shares for $16,000,000</p>
<p>Declaration of cash dividend of $31,000,000</p>
<p>Distribution of 10% share dividend</p>
<p>Use the same market value per share for all transactions.</p>
<p>What is the Retained earnings at the end of 2016? What is the total Equity?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Retained earnings ending balance = 250,000,000 + 446,000,000 - 31,000,000 - 10 % <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> (200,000,000 + 8,000,000 - 2,000,000 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 8) = 500,200,000</p>
<p>Equity ending balance = 400,000 + 84,000,000 + 500,200,000 - 16,000,000 + 64,000,000 + 164,800,000 = 797,400,000</p>
